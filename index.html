		<h2> 8/11/17 : Beginning of a Blog </h2>
		<p>It's been a few months into this project and starting a blog sounds like a good idea to 
		keep track of the accomplisments and process of making this game, while getting used to some 
		HTML and CSS. We will hopefully be filling this site with currently accomplished works among other 
		things over the coming days and weeks; after of course when we figure out how to make this site pretty. 
		Take Care!
